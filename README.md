# Indian Startup Funding Analysis



## 1. Introduction

In the fast-paced world of start-ups, ideas, creativity, and execution are vital ingredients for success. However, to truly flourish, start-ups often rely on financial backing to fuel their growth and make a lasting impact. This project aims to delve into the funding landscape of start-ups in India between 2018 and 2021. By analyzing the funding data and extracting valuable insights, we can guide our team's entry into the Indian start-up ecosystem and propose a strategic course of action.

## 2. Motivation

India has witnessed a remarkable growth in the startup ecosystem, attracting significant investments across various sectors. This project is motivated by the need to analyze and understand the funding dynamics of Indian startups.
